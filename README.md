### TensorFlow
TensorFlow is an open-source framework that simplifies the process of machine learning and neural networking. The course created by **Tim Ruscica** (also known as ‚ÄúTech With Tim‚Äù) covers the powerful capabilities of TensorFlow. 

#### Course Highlights
- **Challenges Completed**: 32 out of 32
- Comprehensive introduction to TensorFlow
- Hands-on experience building neural networks

### How Neural Networks Work
Neural networks are at the core of modern artificial intelligence. This course, led by **Brandon Rohrer**, demystifies neural networks, making them accessible to beginners. 

#### Course Highlights
- **Challenges Completed**: 4 out of 4
- Deep dive into:
  - How Deep Neural Networks Work
  - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
  - Deep Learning fundamentals
  - How Convolutional Neural Networks work

## Machine Learning Projects
The certification includes several hands-on projects designed to solidify your understanding of machine learning concepts. By completing these projects, you demonstrate foundational knowledge in machine learning, qualifying for the **Machine Learning with Python certification**.

### Projects List
1. **[Rock Paper Scissors](./Rock_Paper_Scissors)** ‚úä‚úã‚úåÔ∏è
   - **Description**: Build a model to play the game Rock Paper Scissors against users. Implement a strategy that allows the model to learn from previous moves.

2. **[Cat and Dog Image Classifier](./Cat_and_Dog_Image_Classifier)** üê±üê∂
   - **Description**: Create a classifier that distinguishes between images of cats and dogs using convolutional neural networks. Train the model on a dataset of labeled images.

3. **[Book Recommendation Engine using KNN](./Book_Recommendation_Engine)** üìö
   - **Description**: Develop a K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to recommend books based on user preferences and ratings from the Book-Crossings dataset.

4. **[Linear Regression Health Costs Calculator](./Linear_Regression_Health_Costs_Calculator)** üí∞
   - **Description**: Predict healthcare costs using linear regression on provided datasets. Analyze factors affecting health costs and implement a model to forecast expenses based on user data.

5. **[Neural Network SMS Text Classifier](./Neural_Network_SMS_Text_Classifier)** üì±
   - **Description**: Classify SMS messages as either "ham" or "spam" using a neural network. Train the model on the SMS Spam Collection dataset to accurately predict message classifications.
