# Cat and Dog Image Classifier üê±üê∂

## Overview
This project is a convolutional neural network (CNN) image classifier that distinguishes between images of cats and dogs. Using TensorFlow and Keras, the model is trained on labeled images of cats and dogs to accurately classify new images as either "Cat" or "Dog." This project demonstrates the use of deep learning for image classification tasks.

## Project Structure
- **Dataset**: A labeled dataset of cat and dog images.
- **Model**: A convolutional neural network designed to learn features from the images.
- **Training and Evaluation**: The model is trained on a subset of the dataset and validated on the remaining portion to evaluate its accuracy.
- **Prediction**: The trained model is used to classify new images as either a cat or a dog.
